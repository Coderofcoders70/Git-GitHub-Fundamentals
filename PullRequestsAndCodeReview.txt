# Pull requests and code review

Steps to repeat:

1. Configure branch protection in GitLab to prevent direct pushes to master.
2. Test restrictions by attempting a direct push (git push origin master).
3. Create a new branch, commit your changes, and push it to remote.
4. Create a Pull Request (Merge Request) in GitLab with your branch.
5. Review changes, address comments if needed, and push additional commits.
6. Merge your branch into master after approval via GitLab interface.
