Branching

# Terminology:

-> Branch – an independent version of your repository that allows you to safely develop features or make changes without affecting the main (or master) branch.

-> Merge – combining changes from one branch into another.

Steps to repeat

Create a new branch:
1. git branch new_branch
2. or directly switch: git checkout -b new_branch
3. Switch between branches:
4. git checkout branch_name or git switch branch_name.
5. Create a branch from a previous commit:
6. Switch to specific commit (git checkout <hash>), then create branch from it:git switch -c branch_from_old_commit.
7. Modify files and commit changes to the newly created branches.
8. Merge branch into master:
9. Switch to master branch:git checkout master
10. Merge branch:git merge branch_name
11. Perform squash merge to combine multiple commits into one:
12. git merge --squash source_branch
13. Manage branches with GUI:
14. Create, switch, merge, and delete branches in VSCode or Sourcetree GUI.
15. Delete branches:
16. Terminal:git branch --delete branch_name
17. GUI: right-click branch and select delete.
