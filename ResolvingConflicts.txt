# Resolving conflicts

Terminology:
-> Merge Conflict â€“ occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from two branches.

Steps to repeat:
1. Modify the same line in a file in two separate branches.
2. Attempt to merge these branches (git merge branch_name) and identify conflicts.
3. Open the conflicted file to manually resolve conflicts, editing conflicting sections marked by Git (<<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
4. Stage the resolved files (git add file_name), then complete merge (git merge --continue).
5. Verify the merge result in a GUI tool (e.g., Sourcetree or VSCode).
6. Repeat conflict resolution using VSCode's Merge Editor.
7. Complete or abort the merge (git merge --continue or git merge --abort).
