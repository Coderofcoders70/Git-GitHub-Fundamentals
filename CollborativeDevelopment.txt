# Collaborative development

Terminology:
1. Remote Repository – A shared repository hosted remotely (GitHub, GitLab) for collaboration.
2. Fetch – Retrieves updates from the remote repository without merging.
3. Pull – Retrieves updates and merges them into your current branch.
4. Push – Uploads local commits to the remote repository.

Steps to repeat:
1. Create a remote repository on GitHub or GitLab.
2. Connect your local repository to the remote by running:
    a. git remote add origin <repository_url>
    b. git push -u origin master
3. Push local changes to remote using:
-> git push:  

4. Edit files directly in the remote repository interface and commit changes.

5. Update your local repository by running:
-> git fetch
-> git pull

6. Create and view remote branches:
    View remote branches: git branch -r

7. Fetch branches: git fetch

8. Merge remote branches:
    a. git merge origin/branch_name
 
9. Update files in remote repository interface, fetch and pull those changes locally:
-> git fetch
-> git pull
 
10. Explore remote branches in GUI tools (Sourcetree, VSCode).
